## üöÄ Features at a Glance

-   **Interactive Predictions:** Get instant stock price predictions for any ticker symbol and a specified number of days into the future.
-   **Performance Insights:** See how well our models are performing with key metrics like MSE, MAE, and R2 score.
-   **Easy-to-Use Interface:** A friendly web interface powered by Gradio makes predictions and evaluations a breeze.
-   **Robust API:** Integrate Stocky's powerful prediction and evaluation capabilities into your own applications using our FastAPI endpoints.
-   **Automated Model Refresh:** Models can be refreshed to stay accurate with the latest market data.
-   **Dockerized Deployment:** Easily deploy Stocky anywhere with Docker.

For a comprehensive technical overview, architectural details, codebase guide, and more, please refer to our [Developer Documentation](docs/Readme.md).

## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed. We use `uv` as our package manager for fast and reliable dependency management.

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd Stonky
    ```

2.  **Install `uv` (if you don't have it):**
    ```bash
    pip install uv
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies using `uv`:**
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(You might need to generate `requirements.txt` from `pyproject.toml` if it's not present. A simple `uv pip freeze > requirements.txt` can help.)*

## üèÉ How to Run Stocky

Stocky runs as a web application, accessible through your browser.

1.  **Start the application:**
    ```bash
    uv run main.py
    ```

2.  **Access the interface:**
    Once the application starts, open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (or the address shown in your terminal).

    -   **Prediction Tab:** Enter a stock ticker (e.g., `GOOG`) and the number of days to predict. You'll see a graph and a table of predictions.
    -   **Performance Tab:** Enter a stock ticker to view model performance metrics and a deviation plot.
    -   **Documentation Tab:** Find useful links and a ticker symbol cheatsheet.

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

For easy deployment, Stocky comes with a `Dockerfile`.

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t stonky-app .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 stonky-app
    ```
    This will make the Gradio interface accessible at `http://localhost:8000` and the API endpoints at `http://localhost:8000/api/`.

## üìÇ Project Structure

# Next Steps for Industry-Standard Stock Prediction System

To elevate the Stock Prediction System to an industry-standard level, focus on the following key areas:

## 1. Comprehensive Testing

This is the most critical aspect for an industry-standard project.

*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   For individual functions and classes (e.g., data preprocessing, model training components, API endpoints logic).
    *   Specifically for `src/model.py` (Stonky Class):
        *   `Stonky.predict()`: Provide mock data and assert output format and reasonable values.
        *   `Stonky.evaluate()`: Provide mock data and assert correct MSE, MAE, R² calculations.
        *   `Stonky.train_model()`: Ensure the model trains without errors and potentially assert changes in model weights.
        *   `Stonky.preprocess_data()`: Verify scaling and sequencing logic.
        *   `Stonky.load_model()` and `Stonky.save_model()`: Ensure models and scalers are correctly persisted and loaded.
    *   For `src/download.py`:
        *   `download_stock_data()`: Mock `yfinance` calls and verify data is downloaded and saved correctly.
    *   For `src/refresh.py`:
        *   Test performance-based and time-based refresh triggers (mocking dates and model performance).
*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   To ensure different modules (e.g., data fetching + model training, API + model inference) work correctly together.
    *   Test the full flow from an API call (`/predict`, `/evaluate`, `/refresh`) through to the actual `Stonky` class methods, without mocking the `stonky_instance`.
*   **End-to-End Tests:**
    *   To simulate user flows through the Gradio interface and API, ensuring the entire system functions as expected.
*   **Data Validation Tests:**
    *   To ensure incoming data (from `yfinance` or other sources) adheres to expected schemas and quality.
*   **Error Handling Tests:**
    *   Test API endpoints with invalid inputs (e.g., missing parameters, incorrect data types) and assert appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
    *   Test scenarios where underlying operations fail (e.g., data download fails, model loading fails) and ensure graceful error handling and logging.

## 2. Robust Error Handling and Logging

*   **Centralized Logging:** Implement consistent logging using Python's `logging` module across all components (`src/api.py`, `src/model.py`, `src/refresh.py`, `src/download.py`).
*   **Structured Logging:** Consider libraries like `python-json-logger` or `structlog` for easier analysis.
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Add `try-except` blocks with informative error messages for all potential failure points (file I/O, network requests, model inference).

## 3. Monitoring and Alerting

*   **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** Integrate tools (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana, Datadog) to monitor API response times, error rates, and resource utilization.
*   **Model Performance Monitoring:** Track model metrics (MSE, MAE, R²) over time in production. Set up alerts for significant degradation (model drift).
*   **Data Quality Monitoring:** Monitor incoming data for anomalies or missing values.

## 4. Security Best Practices

*   **API Security:** Implement authentication and authorization for FastAPI endpoints (e.g., API key authentication, OAuth2), especially for sensitive operations.
*   **Secret Management:** Handle API keys and other sensitive information securely (environment variables, secret management services), avoiding hardcoding.
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

## 5. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

*   **Automated Builds:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD) to automatically build Docker images on code pushes.
*   **Automated Testing:** Integrate the comprehensive test suite into the CI/CD pipeline; no deployment without all tests passing.
*   **Automated Deployment:** Automate the deployment of new Docker images to your hosting environment after successful tests.

## 6. Configuration Management

*   **Environment Variables:** Ensure all configurable parameters (e.g., `LOOKBACK`, model paths, API keys) are loaded from environment variables for easy environment-specific configuration.
*   **`src/config.py` Refinement:** Make `src/config.py` a clear interface for accessing these configurations.

## 7. Documentation (Operational)

*   **`DEPLOYMENT.md`:** Create a detailed guide on how to deploy, run, and troubleshoot the application in a production environment.
*   **API Documentation:** Ensure FastAPI's auto-generated OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation at `/docs` is accessible and accurate.
